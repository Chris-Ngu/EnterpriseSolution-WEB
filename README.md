## EnterpriseSolution-WEB
The full stack implementation of EnterpriseSolution I wrote in C#

* I decided to convert this to a web based application because I had a lot of networking libraries and frameworks I relied on and thought it would be more fluid if it was implemented in the enviornment it was trying to operate in.

# Working features
Nothing so far, just setting up UI

# WIP 
* Login Screen: Logo off center, either center the login module or include more information about the company (Maybe include third party login)

# Photos
