## EnterpriseSolution-WEB
The full stack implementation of [EnterpriseSolution](https://github.com/Chris-Ngu/EnterpriseSolution) I wrote in C#

* I decided to convert this to a web based application because I had a lot of networking libraries and frameworks I relied on and thought it would be more fluid if it was implemented in the enviornment it was trying to operate in.

# Technologies
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* NodeJS

# Working features
Nothing so far, just setting up UI

# WIP 
* Login Screen: Double check the JWT integration, I can get passed by using the specific url(JWT Being deleted on some routes/ checks not working)
* Flash message warning to alert of missing/ incorrect fields (registration and login)
* Redesign the UI/ navbar integration to the left hand side for fluidity
* Redesign the UI for projects (including substring of date)
* Fix pages not working (Linked to navbar integration)
* JWT Timer and refresh token
